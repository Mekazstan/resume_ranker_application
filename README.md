# Resume Ranker Application (This is just a demo ðŸ˜Š)

## Overview

This application is a smart tool designed to help streamline the process of reviewing job applications.

It goes beyond simple keyword matching to understand the skills, experience, and overall suitability of each candidate.
3.  **Relevance Scoring:** For each submitted resume, the application assigns a relevance score on a scale of 1 to 10, indicating how well the candidate's profile aligns with the job requirements.
4.  **Reasoning and Explanation:** Alongside the score, the application provides a brief explanation highlighting the key factors that contributed to the assigned relevance score. This helps understand the rationale behind the ranking.
